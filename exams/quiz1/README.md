1. VCS has three categories Local VCS, Centralized VCS (CVCS), and distributed VCS (DVCS). Local VCS keeps track of individual files of the project only in the local storage device/computer. Local VCS works by having one file in checkout with different versions on the version database. Local VCS solved the issue of data redundancy and storage ineefficiancy
+ Centralized VCS has a central repository that is can be opened by all team members and contains all of the projects information and devolping changes. Central VCS fixed the issue of local VCS by allowing all team members to access the project, look at changes, and work on individual files.
+ DVCS works by having a server computer with the version databases and having the files and versions  on individal computers. That way there is a full backup of the project through cloning which can be used for restoration. DVCS solved the issue of loosing the project by creating a backup method.
