Quiz 2 
1. (A) The closest programming language is Assembly 
   (B) Yes it does need interptation the assembler interpts the program  
   
2. (A) Fortran
   (B) The program was released in 1976 +15 years old 
   
3.  (A)Assembly 
    (B) Third generation for Fortan, C, C++ and fourth generation for MATLAB, Pythonm and R
4. C was made in 1971, C++ was made in 1983, Matlab/python  was made in 1991 

5. An ancestral programming language of C is B 
6. An language ancestro of C++ is C with classes 
7. Ancestor for python is Fortran and C
8. Syntax error for example (3\2) will give you a syntax error 
   semantic errors 
   runtme errors 
9. The least dangerous kind of errorr is syntax error becuse if you enter in a syntax error the code won't run until you fix it 
10. The most dangerous kind of error to fix is a semeantic error because the code runs and it is hard for the interpter to find it 
11. runtime error 
12. 2,147,483,647
13. int16 stores 16 bits and int64 store 64 bits  
14. print('Python Is Great For String Manipulation.' replace('', '')[::1]) 
15. print('Python Is Great For String Manipulation.'[::-2])
16. empty_dict = {}
17. When an integer overflow happens the overflowed variable cycles and then the value starts over again from the smallest one 
18. 
19. 
20. Value coercian is the implicit process by which the interperter automatically converts a value of one type into a value of another type when the secound type is required by the surronding context. An example of this is 2.0 *7  this will give you a 14.0 float answer. The product of a float and an integer is coerced into a float
21. Alliasing goes to the same memory while copies go to differnt memmories. Alliasing will edit the same list and copying will edit difffernt lists 
22. == checks if the values are equal while is checks if there the exact same 
23. this makes a=1 b=2, c=3 
24. This makes the two brackets the same
